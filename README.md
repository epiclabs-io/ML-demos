# Machine Learning demos

## Smoker detection

This demo will detect smokers in real time. The detector can be chosen: either an inception network retrained or our own network.

## Metadata enhancement

This demo will detect general categories and show them in a cloud tag. When the video is finished the categories can be grouped in certain taxonomies using an embedding matrix.

## Contextual advertising

This demo will detect general categories and show products from Amazon while the video is playing. Once it is finished products from Amazon of the most relevant tags will be shown.
